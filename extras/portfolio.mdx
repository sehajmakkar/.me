## Introduction

A collection of my UI/UX projects showcasing my skills in design and development
This portfolio showcases my passion for creating smooth, modern user experiences through thoughtful design and cutting-edge technologies. I've leveraged powerful libraries and frameworks to create engaging interactions:

### Modern Animation & Interactions

- **Framer Motion** for fluid page transitions and micro-interactions
- Smooth scroll animations that respond to user viewport
- Parallax effects and gesture-based animations
- Seamless dark/light theme transitions

### Performance & Best Practices 

- Next.js 14 with server components for optimal loading
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS
- Accessibility-first approach with ARIA labels and semantic HTML
