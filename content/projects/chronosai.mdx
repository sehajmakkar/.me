## Overview

**ChronosAI** is a full-stack developer platform that merges real-time AI-assisted coding with team collaboration capabilities. Designed for engineers, product builders, and learners, it transforms abstract ideas into structured, functional codebases with minimal manual effort. By combining conversational AI, live collaboration, and intelligent project scaffolding, ChronosAI offers a streamlined, scalable development environment built for speed and productivity.

## Context and Purpose

Modern development workflows often begin with repetitive setup: creating folder structures, wiring boilerplate logic, integrating libraries, and configuring environments. These tasks, while essential, consume valuable time that could be spent on solving product-specific problems.

Additionally, collaboration across distributed teams introduces friction—sharing ideas, resolving issues, and coordinating contributions can slow down velocity. There’s a growing need for platforms that abstract low-leverage work, foster real-time collaboration, and augment developer capabilities using AI.

**ChronosAI addresses this gap** by functioning as an intelligent co-pilot and team workspace—capable of bootstrapping entire projects, reviewing code, and supporting multi-user coding sessions via a unified interface.

## Key Capabilities

1. **Intelligent Project Scaffolding**  
   Developers can describe an app idea (e.g., “a real-time chat with authentication”), and ChronosAI generates a complete directory structure and starter code tailored to that use case.

2. **Real-Time AI-Powered Chat**  
   Integrated with Google’s Gemini API, ChronosAI provides conversational support for code generation, debugging, architecture decisions, and documentation writing.

3. **Live Collaboration Environment**  
   Built-in socket-based infrastructure enables real-time communication and editing. Teammates can chat, review code, and co-develop within the same session.

4. **Instant Code Review and Suggestions**  
   Developers receive AI-driven code quality feedback and optimization suggestions while writing or pasting code.

5. **Multi-Modal Communication Layer**  
   Code snippets, system prompts, and team discussions are unified in a persistent collaborative workspace.

6. **Streamlined Architecture**  
   Full separation of concerns between frontend and backend, built with scalability and extensibility in mind.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
- **Caching Layer**: Redis

The frontend and backend are modularized and container-ready, allowing for rapid deployment and horizontal scaling in multi-user environments.

## Intended Use Cases

- **Startup Builders & Hackers**  
  Accelerate MVP development by bypassing boilerplate and immediately focusing on business logic.

- **Remote Engineering Teams**  
  Collaborate on early-stage architecture or prototyping efforts in real time, with AI assisting in code creation and validation.

- **Engineering Education**  
  Create a hands-on, feedback-rich environment for learning new frameworks, APIs, and development workflows.

- **Developer Productivity**  
  Use ChronosAI as a personal assistant to scaffold side projects, refactor legacy code, or quickly spin up feature branches.
