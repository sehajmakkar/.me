## Key Capabilities

1. **Intelligent Project Scaffolding**  
   Developers can describe an app idea (e.g., “a real-time chat with authentication”), and ChronosAI generates a complete directory structure and starter code tailored to that use case.

2. **Real-Time AI-Powered Chat**  
   Integrated with Google’s Gemini API, ChronosAI provides conversational support for code generation, debugging, architecture decisions, and documentation writing.

3. **Live Collaboration Environment**  
   Built-in socket-based infrastructure enables real-time communication and editing. Teammates can chat, review code, and co-develop within the same session.

4. **Instant Code Review and Suggestions**  
   Developers receive AI-driven code quality feedback and optimization suggestions while writing or pasting code.

5. **Multi-Modal Communication Layer**  
   Code snippets, system prompts, and team discussions are unified in a persistent collaborative workspace.

6. **Streamlined Architecture**  
   Full separation of concerns between frontend and backend, built with scalability and extensibility in mind.
