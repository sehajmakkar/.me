## What is DocTime?

**DocTime** is a full-stack appointment management platform designed for the healthcare sector, supporting **role-based access control (RBAC)** across three distinct panels: user, doctor, and admin. With dedicated interfaces and functionalities for each role, DocTime enables seamless patient-doctor interaction, streamlined appointment scheduling, and centralized administrative oversight.

## System Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   Every route and interface is protected according to user role, ensuring secure and context-appropriate access.

2. **Separation of Concerns via Multi-Panel Design**  
   Individual frontends for users and admins enable clean separation of concerns, improving both scalability and maintainability.

3. **Dynamic Doctor Search and Booking**  
   Users can filter doctors by specialization and availability, then seamlessly book appointments with real-time updates.

4. **Doctor Availability Management**  
   Doctors can define their schedules, block off times, and manage consultations directly from their dashboards.

5. **Administrative Control and Analytics**  
   Admins can approve doctors, track global appointments, manage specializations, and access platform-wide metrics.

6. **Cloud Integration for Media Storage**  
   Profile and certification uploads are stored securely using **Cloudinary**, with **Multer** handling upload processing.

## Authentication and Access Control

DocTime implements a secure authentication and authorization flow:

- **JWT-based authentication** ensures tokenized access for all user types.
- Middleware enforces access control policies based on assigned roles.
- Sensitive routes are protected using scoped route guards to prevent unauthorized data access or manipulation.

Each user role operates on an isolated interface and API layer, minimizing risk and maintaining a coherent permission boundary.
